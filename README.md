# Hand-Detection---Computer-Vision
Hand Detection in Computer vision using OpenCV and MediaPipe. 

# Steps:

To begin the process of hand detection using MediaPipe, the first step is to install it (if you are a first time user) by running the command !pip install mediapipe.

The next step is to import the necessary libraries, which include cv2 and mediapipe as mp.

To detect your hands, you need to identify your webcam using the command cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) for local webcam, or cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1) for an external webcam. Once the webcam is identified, you can leverage the MediaPipe library to detect your hands by using the Hand Detection API.

Finally, you can run the code to enable your webcam and visualize the hand landmarks on the image or video to verify the accuracy of the detection.
